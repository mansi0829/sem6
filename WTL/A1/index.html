                    Slowly the sun was disappearing beneath the waves as last rays were visible and leaving its only
                    hints in reddish sky. The sea was getting more active and violent. It looked like that the storm
                    would occur, and I thought what would I do if it would really happen. I was scared and did not want
                    to spend the night on the beach freezing and being frightened by the sea storm. I started to cry
                    like a child that got lost. Then suddenly I felt that somebody put his or her hand on my shoulder.
                    My body winced and I was scared to turn around. But I did and I saw my friend standing behind me.
                    She started to cry and explain to me why she was so late. I didn?t feel any anger at her any more
                    because for an unknown reason it was all gone when I saw her. We watched the end of the sunset,
                    jumped into the car and left. While we were driving I looked back to that beach, the sea and the
                    last rays of the sun as if I was saying good bye to a friend .</p>
